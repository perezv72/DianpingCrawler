# Diangping Crawler
The program downloads search results from Dianping (China's Yelp) and saves them to a subdirectory. The extract goes through the files in the *html* subdirectory and scrapes basic business data, such as business name and address, from the html documents. The *urls.txt* shows how the urls should be formatted.
